ðŸ”¬ Predicting Bioactivity of CML-Related Ligands Using Random Forest

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline developed to predict the pIC50 values of ligand molecules targeting Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)-related proteins using the Random Forest regression model.

ðŸš€ Features
Dataset preparation from ligand structures (e.g., SMILES)
Feature extraction using RDKit (molecular descriptors + fingerprints)
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Training a Random Forest Regressor to predict pIC50 values
Model evaluation using metrics like RÂ², RMSE
Visualization of feature importance and performance
